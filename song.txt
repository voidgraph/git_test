On my first day back, my first day back in town
First day, my first day back in town
The clouds up above, they were hummin' our song
Hummin,' hummin' our song

My biggest fear is if I let you go
You'll come and get me in my sleep
My biggest fear is if I let you go
You'll come and get me in my sleep
